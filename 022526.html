      I have never based a project about girlhood before 
      mainly because i dont think i am that girly 
      aestheics wise 
      i think my girlhood experience has been a very specific unfortunate subgenre of girlhood 
      my main girlhood thing is sad cute things and vagina issues 
      pcos 
      bleeding 
      birth control 
      extra testrone 
      facial hair 
      body hair 
      rage 
      depression 
      shitty men 
      mothering my boyfriends 
      pedophiles 
      guy friends who will comfort you through your hardships because they want to fuck you 
      beautiful shoes who blister and deglove your feet 
      eating disorders
      
      i dont think i want to die 
      i think more i want to run away 
      like really far away 
      and restart everything 
      one year ago around this time was my happiest few days i think ive had in a while 
      just around this time last year i was so so happy 
      and i keep trying to chase that same happiness but i dont think i will get it back 
      i have been miserable lately 
      i tried to literally off myself like two weeks ago 
      so safe to say i am not doing well mentally 
      i have no one in providence 
      i am utterly miserable 
      i havn’t had any motivation to do anything 
      i am creativly and emotionally constipated 
      i am lonely 
      im so unbelivably unhappy 
      i just really want to disappear 
      i dont want to die 
      i dont think so 
      i just dont like how my life is going right now 
      and I dont know how to get out of that 
      i just want to be happy 
      i dont know how to be happy 
      i think me placing all of my happiness within a person is too much 
      theres no happiness there anymore 
      its torture 
      its genuine torture 

      everyday i take this stick and i stab myself with it 
      when I eat things 
      i usually eat the yuckiest part first 
      then gobble down the yummier parts 

      i dont want the yucky parts 
      i just want the yummy ones 
      i just 
      i dont know 
      i am miserable 
      i am so deeply miserable 
      everything hurts 
      i have nothing 
      i have no one 
      i dont want to go anywhere 
      i dont want to do anything 
      i just 
      i dont know 
      i dont know what i want 
      i dont even know 
      i just want to be happy again 
      but i dont know how to get there 
      i am so deeply hurt 
      and each part of me 
      i dont recognise 
      i just
      i have nothing 
      i dont want to go anywhere 
      i just want to melt into my bed 
      i cant do this anymore 
      i dont want to 
      i hate it 
      i hate it 
      i hate it 
      i hate it 
      i hate it 
      i hate it 
      i hate it 

      i was so happy a year ago 
      i was in such a good place 
      really i really really was 
      i was so happy 
      i took care of myself 
      i loved my apartment 
      i loved my life 
      i loed everything around me 
      i had friends
      i had things to do 
      i had places to go 
      i had places i wanted to go 
      i had motivation to do things 
      i had hobbies
      i cant live this way 
      i am so upset 
      my future is black 
      its pitch black 
      i cant see anything past graduation 
      hell i cant even see anything past july 
      theres nothing there for me 
      theres nothing left 
      i gave away every part of me 
      and now im left empty 
      theres nothing left 
      i really 
      i have nothing left
      i tried it all 
      i tried everything 
      i tried 

      i turn 24 this year 
      the past 13 years of my life have been miserable 
      sure it was not all miserable 
      but i really
      so really 
      just want to run away somewhere and disappear 
      im not good at anything 
      even if you were to point something i was ok at 
      im not good enough at it to survive 
      whats the point at being ok at something 
      if im just miserable all the fucking time 
      i dont think im one of those people when im having a hard time i reach out to people 
      when im truly this miserable i usually just crawl into a hole and disappear for a while 
      i dont want to burden people with my problems 
      what are they going to do about it 
      pitty me 
      its uncomfortable 
      i dont want to bother anyone with my problems 
      its my problems 
      only i can solve them 

      if its really like this
      where all i am is alone
      and the one person who supposedly loved me the most 
      can turn around and treat me this way 
      what am i worth 
      i built myself up so much to think better than this
      but lately its all come down to nothing 
      i am just miserable 

      i dont know what to do 
      i just want to disappear 
      i dont know what to do
