    i didn’t really do much today 
    I was going to get up earlier to go to school and be productive today, but then I got kind of stuck, 
    and I didn't do my makeup immediately after my shower and got back in bed instead, so I got stuck there. 
    I spent my day watching food reviews and Taipei and Tokyo walkthroughs with Razan 
    We watched anime too and then started watching this korean shaman show
    i don’t know if I believe in spiritual things that extensivly 
    to a certain extent i I find it scamy and i think people just crave community 
    and need something of heigher power to believe in. I get it, its easier to go through life when its not all dependant on yourself,
    its nice to know theres someone there loving and watching over you. Its also comforting to know that theres something beyond death. 
    I like to believe in reincarnation
    I want to believe that I’ve lived through this life before 
    or other ones 
    I want to believe that I’ve gone through life before and have ended up somewhere 
    I want to hope I was happy in those lives 
    or if not that the bad in those lives have granted me a happy life in this life 
    I wasn’t productive today 
    I ordered pizza for lunch 
    but I ordered it before the resturant opened 
    and so I had to schedule it for later in the day
    but while I was waiting I was hungry and then got caught by doordash’s add more 
    with no fees and so I got coffee and a little sandwich for later
    but then the coffee and sandwich arrived before the pizza
    so by the time the pizza was here I had already eaten the sandwich because I was hungry 
    then I ate a slice of pizza
    and it was so cold outside I didn’t want to move
    so I got stuck in bed 
    but now its 6pm and I still don’t feel like moving 
    yves keeps visiting me 
    he keeps chewing on hands 

    Today I learned about the Papua Dani Tribe 
    theyre fun 
    they wear very little clothing 
    the men just wear a penis gourd which is like this orange horn-shaped thing 
    do you think they know 6 7 
    theyre really cute they say “wa” a lot which is like a term of general welcome and acceptance 
    they smoke like cigerettes that are tabacco rolled with leaves 
    very interesting 
    they remove a section of their fingers each time a loved one dies 
    i feel like this action of self mutlation after grief is really kind of romantic 
    when people die in our society others just post an Instagram story and go back to their explore page
    and tap through brainrot 
    If we self-mutilate ourselves or just practice more self-inflicted ways of grief, 
    would we treasure others’ lives more ? 

    I really enjoy learning more about different cultures and traditions 
    especially traditions surrounding death and grief 
    Razan taught me that muslim Indonesians wrap their loves one in a white cloth after they die
    and the day after the body is rested in their home, and all their loves one come and send their blessings
    their bodies are then burried and after the decomposing process the body is dug back up and burned 
    i never even thought about these different ways of honoring the dead 
    I had been so used to just caskets and urns that after learning about these new traditions 
    it helped me grasp a bit more about my own death
    i dont know 

    my stomach hurts

    is it possible to crave a food ive never tried before 
    i dont know what it tastes like
    if i watch enough videos of foods have i eatten everything 
    there are flavors ill never get to try 
    what do i do
    im greedy 

    I want to learn more languages 
    i pick them up pretty well 
    once u know one from a reigon its a lot easier to learn the rest 
    i failed spanish class in 7th grade though haha 
    i think i am good at picking up at noises and im good at reading context 
    i will learn bahasa 
    i am stubborn 
    i will do it i can do it 
    especially since i dont need to learn new reading or writing characters
    thats the hardest part


    if i fail in furniture i want to become a mukbang youtuber
    i would probably fail at that too 
    i have a terrible stomach 
    i ruined it that year I was bullemic 
    lol

    what are other peoples inner thoughts 
    i feel like mine are so stupid
    do other people think more about work 
    my brain is just food and cats and my lover thats why when one goes wrong i lose it

    is it in my taiwanese blood to need to eat all the time
    i cant stop watching food videos 
    ive never been one to be into muckbangs but do people like them because its an exaderated amount of eating
    that it somewhat satisfies your cravings? 
    like porn? when people watch exhaderated porn to get hornier 
    lol 
    not sure

    i have strech marks on my thighs 

    i always order way more food than I can eat myself 

    god my stomach hurts so bad

    razan made me this book today
    hes so funny
