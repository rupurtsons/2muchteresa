      i ran out of rice like two weeks ago 
      since then ive been eating random things 
      i would never treat my cats this way 
      today for lunch i ate ayam bawang indomie 
      it was ok , it kind of just tasted like chicken-flavored cup noodle
      i dont even know if they sell those anymore
      i tried to feed that to razan last time when we were in montak 
      but we couldn’t find any????

      i cant stop watching food vlogs 
      i want boba 

      its snowing today 
      it sh
      i added my diy bawang sambal into it and that made it a lot yummier 
      and fried shallots 
      i may be a culinary genius
      Before Bulduk Ramen was super famous 
      back in like 2018 ish id say 
      i took the regular flavor and mixed in soy sauce and sacha sause and my mom said 
      that I could sell that in restaurants 
      it was so good
      im really good at pairing things with instand noodle 
      i think
      Maybe my palette is just 
      really underdeveloped 
      well that can’t be true 
      i have eaten so many diverse foods 

      its snowing today 
      i woke up this morning to so much snow my first words today were “WHAT THE FUCK”
      my bedroom windows were completely blocked with snow,
      same with my side doors
      insane! 
      i’ve never been in a snowstorm so intense before! 
      maybe when I was younger in like Tahoe or something, but 
      not that i can remember 
      i took yeb outside to play in the snow
      but i dont think he was too big of a fan 
      he enjoyed it for a little but then he said he wanted to go home 
      hes been so clingly recently 
      ive been waking up to him snuggled up next to or behind my face every morning 
      a few nights ago he flopped onto my face while I was asleep and I jumped awake confused 
      as to what this giant fluffy thing was 
      i was so scared 

      i miss my boyfriend 
      is is possible to be too attached to a person
      is it possible to be addicted to a person 
      if so i am addicted 
      Whenever he is asleep i feel like I'm weaning off of some sort of drug I was addicted to 
      i get so restless 
      thats so unbelievably embarrassing 

      for my glass class we have to map out some different movement that happen in a certain space 
      when I think movement 
      i think of my petcam 
      Then of the petcam 
      I think of my living room 
      after all thats where all the the motion is captured 
      I got this new petcam that tracks movement 
      maily for the cats but it tracks me when I move around as well
      I exported a few clips of me moving around in the living room 
      but its mainly me walking around 
      from my kitchen to my bedroom 
      from the bedroom back to the kitchen 
      bedroom to the window 
      then many clips of me walking over things to sit down 
      or sitting down and drinking water 
      or sitting down and working on my computer
      or sitting down and talking to my computer 
      or sitting down watching things 
      or sitting down eating 
      or simply just trying to find where’s comfortable 
      This isn’t really a space where my movements are thought through in a way that I must maintain any sort of composure 
      but its a place where I sometimes walk through naked 
      after all its just me and my two cats 
      I have a lot of these clips where while I was searching through the human movement recordings doing strange things 
      of things falling and I just stare and go back to watching tv 
      there are several clips of me just biting my nails 
      wiggling my feet while theyre propped up on my coffee table 
      where I am eating way faster than I can swallow my food 
      there are several clips of me pushing my evil cat off the coffee table to prevent him from stealing my food 
      im sniffing my hair a lot in these clips 
      but the majority of the human movement clips are me walking through the living room to the other parts of my apartment or walking around aimlessly trying to find something 


      I think i might be depressed 
      I just redid my nails but i want to pick them all off again 
      it feels like there are worms in my skin 


      I LOVVEEEEE the twinkle twinkles
      theyre so fucking ugly but so CUTTEEE
      i think i like things like that
      things that are kinda ugly 
      but then so cute
      i really love these yellow plushie things
      that are fluffy
      and soft
      and hugable 
      i dont think i was held long enough as a kid haha

      i really love my cats 
      i could hold their little bodies and snort their head smells forever 
      their fluffly little bodies
      if i could bottle up their smell then turn that smell into a powder I would snort it 
      i would 
      through my right nostril 

      I find labubus so fucking ugly 
      i hate their faces
      its obnoxcious 
      what the fuck is whatnot 

      i think im depressed

      wait i really love these cute things but i cant ever make anything cute
      like everytime i try to make something cute
      it turns out creepy as fuck lol

      i dont really think about design in a daily context tbh 
      most of my thoughts are just about stupid things food and cats 
      but maybe thats because i just havnt gone outside lately

      back when i was at my upper east side job my coworker gave me a cat calander 
      its been stuck on november 2025 
      i havnt chaneged it yet 
      i should just go back to the janurary page and start again from there 

      I think i need to write my thoughts down like this because i will forget 
      dementia runs in my family 
      i am almost certain i will have dementia in the future 
      i already dont remember things 
      i only remember things when theyre written down 
      or photo or videographed 
      is that why my cameraroll is 80000 pictures and videos? 
      do i even have 80000 memories? 

      the most interesting thing about me is probably 
      and actually i dont know this so this is in razans words 
      "is how funny i am"
      am i funny 
      i think im funny 
      but i dont know if everyone thinks im funny
      i think im funnier in my head than out loud 
      i talk to much when im around people 
      its annoying
      i think i might just be lonely
      i sometimes think faster than i can talk and so i end up talking really fast
      i hate people who talk slowly
      why is it taking you so long to spit out your sentence 
      hurry up
      i saw someone ask eileen gu if she thinks before she speaks 
      and i started wondering how many people actually have to form their sentences before they come out 
      i do sometimes practice conversations in my head 
      and then get freaked out when the conversation doesnt go as it did in my head 

      i got bullied a lot growing up 
      it really shaped me as a person 
      i am a very insecure person 
      i have crazy bad anxiety 
      i get heart palpitations when im stressed 
      i grew up thinking i was ugly 
      then i had an evil burden who made be feel like the ugliest person in the world 
      i had every bit of self confidence stripped away from me 
      i thought i was so ugly i could die 
      but i was never the ugly one 
      anyways now i look back and im pretty sure the boys who picked on me just had crushes that 
      they didnt know what to do about 
      because now they still stalk me online 


      my design identity most of the time 100% is just me pulling the most obnoxious niche references i know 
      then combining it into something that makes sense to me 
      but then not to other people 
      through an excessive amount of unnecessary steps haha
