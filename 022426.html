    i fucking hate momma’s boys 
    i was not raised that way 
    i raised myself
    its embaressing that you cant think of what to do without ur mommy
    i would rather die then end up with an inlaw like that 

    i refuse to live with in laws who hate me for no reason 
    why should i have to go through that 
    i have worked hard enough in my own life
    i come from a good background 
    my family is nice 
    there is literally nothing wrong with me 
    why should i be looked down upon for not living up to whatever their standards are 
    is love for a person enough to be tortured by the ones around them?
    no. 
    no it is not.

    wait it really never gets better 
    ive watched so many of my friends go through it from relationship issues 
    ive watched people go through insane psychosis from men
    is it that hard to respect and love someone 

    wait im at an age now where my parents bitch to me about dating equally as much as work 

    i need to be taken care of 
    i need to be shown love 
    no one looked at me when i was a kid 
    i did it all myself 
    no one knew what to do when i was sad
    when i was hurt i got yelled at for crying
    i almost got amputated because i told my parents something was wrong and they didnt listen 

    i walked to the er alone at 2am 

    i dont want a son 

    is marriage even about love 
    or is it just a more manipulative way of work 
    not sure 

    to what extent do i need to accept microcheating to be ok with modern relationships

    is loving someone for their personality enough 
    or is it what comes after that really makes it 

    is falling in love with someone the end of it 
    what happens after seriously 
    can you maintain it 
    is the maintnance of that love what makes the love special
    likeing a person is easy 
    liking or loving them enough to love them they way they needed is another matter

    i want kids though 
    i like taking care of things 
    i love my cats 
    i could live with just them forever 
    but if i got pregnant right now i think i would have a lot of trouble getting rid of it 

    i heard that each person has about 6000 thoughts a day 
    if i wrote each of my thoughts down could i write a book 

    i saw someone trying to sell a cat on poshmark the other day 

    I think I’ll end up killing myself sooner or later
    
    I’ve wanted to since I was 11
    I can write inspiring artist statements about quirky stories of my childhood but the reality was that I’ve wanted to end my life before it even began 
    I very clearly remember one day I just lost my spark
    I think I wrote a post on Google plus about how I’ve lost my girlyness but I don’t think it was the girlyness that I lost I think it was my ability to find joy in things 
    There are things that make me happy still but 
    I think I grew up being shamed for doing things out of happiness instead of to improve my future 
    I don’t know how to generate joy 
    Now when I’m not working I’m just horizontal 
    I don’t really have dreams 
    I don’t have any grand missions I’ve set out to accomplish 
    I don’t know 
    Everynight I go to bed in the same position
    Curled up hugging a plushie with one wrist bent at a 90 degree angle and my hand tucked under my chin 
    Is that how I’ll die
    When I die I won’t be in that position
    Will I turn to dust 
    Belinda didn’t want to be cremated 
    Maybe something changed after we had that conversation 
    I don’t know 
    When I die what will become of my mind 
    Will all thoughts end 
    Will I get stuck in a dream like state
    Or will it just be nothing 
    I’m scared to die 
    I am scared to become nothing
    I’m scared to be empty 
    I’m so afraid
